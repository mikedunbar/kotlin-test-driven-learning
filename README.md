# kotlin-test-driven-learning
[Kotlin](kotlinlang.org) sample code in the form of [Spek](http://spekframework.org) unit tests, written as I go through the book [Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action). 

The emphasis is on capturing knowledge in the tests, kind of like taking notes - only they are executable sample code, so all the better. The emphasis
is NOT on writing good unit tests in general, writing well factored DRY code, etc. It really is just about walking away with executable notes on the language.

Right now this only works as-is when imported into Intellij, and not when imported into Android Studio 2.3, but I may fix that at some point.
