# kotlin-test-driven-learning
[Kotlin](kotlinlang.org) sample code in the form of [Spek](http://spekframework.org) unit tests, developed as I go through the book [Kotlin in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kotlin-in-action). 

Right now this only works as-is when imported into Intellij, and not when imported into Android Studio 2.3, but I may fix that at some point.
